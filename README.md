# Suzuhara Minecraft Configuration

This is a configuration from our experimental Minecraft server - codenamed "Suzuhara". This is intended mainly to run for Kubernetes with this specific configuration:

- [K3s](https://k3s.io)
- [Longhorn Block Storage](https://longhorn.io/)
- [Rancher](https://rancher.com)
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io)
- [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/)

Keep in mind we didn't test this for other configurations, so this may not work for your distribution or cluster.

## Requesting a plugin?

If you're here requesting a plugin from our Minecraft server, please drop your PR here for the plugins directory. Keep in mind that your plugin must meet the following conditions:

- It must be Fabric API (we use Fabric)
- It must be Open Source (Please link the plugin to your PR's message.)
- It must be prebuilt when committed to the plugins directory.

If this satisfies our conditions, then you are free to commit away your prebuilt plugin request through a pull request.
